## PID review

A FFT tool for reviewing flight logs and PID settings. A windowed FFT is applied to the logged PID data, the step response is extracted by estimating the transfer function between the target and actual. Log is split in to sections based on parameter changes.

### Comparing two logs

Use `compare.html` to load two logs side by side. Each log is shown in its own copy of the tool so graphs can be compared easily.
